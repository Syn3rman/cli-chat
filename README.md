# cli-chat
Cli based group chat to stay connected in lab pracs :P


## Why : Wanted to work with sockets in python ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## To-do's:
[] Scan network and give client option to choose the host to connect to.
[] Persist messages some way so that people who join later can see the previous chats (say, last 10 messages)
[] Private messages to another user (?)
